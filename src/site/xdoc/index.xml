		<section name="Properties Management for Java">
			<p>Prom is a Java API built around the standard java.util.Properties class. It provides lifecycle management to a properties file (loading, saving, resetting to default values) as well as access to properties using a custom-defined key and convenience methods to retrieve properties as specific types, such as boolean, integer, Enum, etc. Prom also provides variable substitution (by default, it works in the style of Ant) to allow property references from within a properties file.</p>
			<p>Project development is tracked on <a href="https://launchpad.net/prom">Launchpad</a> where you can contribute by submitting <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/prom">bug reports</a>, working on <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/prom">blueprints</a>, or submitting patches.</p>
